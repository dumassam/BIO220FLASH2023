Define Recruitment and Stock.*Recruitment is new additions to the population, whereas stock is the current population.
What are N, r, and K with respect to the logistic model.?*Abundance, intrinsic rate of growth, carrying capacity.
What is the inflection point of the Logistic Model? What does this suggest about harvesting strategies?*The inflection point is K/2. This suggests that we harvest populations from K to K/2, as the maximum growth rate occurs here. 
Define the Maximum Economic Yield.*Where the Benefit minus Cost is maximized.
Defined the Maximum Sustained Yield.*Point of maximum population growth.
As seen with fishing, what is the relationship between K/2 and fishing effort?*As K/2 increases, Fishing effort decreases and vice-versa.
What are the three options that we explored for sustainable harvesting?*Fixed quota (MSY), Fixed effort, and Fixed escapement.
Although the K/2 strategy is theoretically the best method, what might occur in reality hinders its strength?*Populations fluctuate and thus in bad years, our K/2 harvesting entails N < K/2.
Define the Fixed Escape Strategy.*Allow for a certain percentage of the population to migrate before the harvesting season.
What are two frequent qualia that determine how harvesting occurs?*Size thresholds, Trophy ornaments.
How do we measure the intensity of Truncation selection?* The difference in the mean of the population after selection compared to the mean before selection (s = z* - z).
A major ice storm leads to mortality in grindylows. Before the ice storm, the mean body size was 8g. After the ice storm, the mean body size was 10g.
What is the selection differential? What direction of body size evolution we would predict?*s = 2. We predict increased size to evolve.
How does trophy hunting in sheep affect their horn size?*Smaller sheep horns evolve as a result of trophy hunting, despite sexual selection. 
How do we expect harvesting to impose selection on phenotypes?*We expect it to impose selection on lots of phenotypes.
What does it mean for a trait to be dimorphic?*The trait occurs differently in the two sexes.
How can we characterize the trait of tusks in Elephants?*A dominant X-linked locus that is lethal in males.
Is it possible to have a tuskless male? What are the sex chromosomes which determine the presence/absence of this trait?*It is impossible as these elephants die in utero. Presence: xY, Absence: XY.
What can be said about the sex ratio within the elephant species, as a result of the tusk trait?*Since we lose half of the male offspring (due to XY dying), there is a female-biased sex ratio.
If birth and immigration rates are greater than death and emigration rates (assume they are constant) then the growth trajectory is:*Density-independent and exponential.
What are the statistical reasons extrapolating from the logistic model gives poor predictions?*Extrapolating beyond the range of the data may present inconsistencies, this is not to correct model to explain this density-dependent population.
What are the biological reasons extrapolating from the logistic model gives poor predictions?*This model does not allow overshoots and assumes r and K to be constants.
How can we explain the radical shift in the rate of growth of humans?*Birth rates have increased for much of human history, but major declines in death rates in the 19th-20th century have furthered increased r.
Fill in the blanks: Changes in health care raised ____, while changes in agriculture raised ____.*r, K.
In 1970, the human population was growing at about 2% per year, and now is growing at about 1.1% a year. Is this still growing exponentially?*Yes it is still growing exponentially since r = 1.1% = 0.011 > 0. 
Define population momentum .*Population momentum is a phenomenon that occurs in fast-growing populations where there is an excess of children.
With respect to population momentum, what occurs when r goes to zero?*The population continues to grow as the youngest generation reaches reproductive age.
Fill in the blanks. During periods of high momentum, the age pyramid has a __________ shape, whereas in periods of low momentum the age pyramid has a __________ shape.*Triangular, Oval.
With respect to fertility rates, what is the replacement level?*On average, women are having more than 2 children (mean > 2).
What is the first stage of the Demographic Transition Model?*Pre-industrial, birth and death rates were both high, r near zero.
What is the second stage of the Demographic Transition Model?*Death rates drop (health improvements), but birth rates stay high; the population booms.
What is the third stage of the Demographic Transition Model?*Birth rates fall (contraception, changing values, later marriage), and growth rates slow.
What is the fourth stage of the Demographic Transition Model?*Birth and death rates equilibrate, r near zero again.
